                        incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was
                        the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us,
                        we had nothing before us...

                        The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers,
                        the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else,
                        and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a
                        clear conscience have taken his oath on the two...

                        A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound
                        secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night,
                        that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every
                        one of them encloses its own secret;

                        the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily
